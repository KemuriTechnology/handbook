# Stand Up Meeting

## What is Stand-up?
**Daily Stand-up**  
Code Puzzle project has daily standup at 11 30 AM (IST).

In the Stand-ups, everyone answers the following three questions -   
* What did I work on yesterday?  
* What am I working on today?  
* What issues are blocking me?  

(You can read more about Stand-ups [here](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups))

The scope of the Stand-up is just these three questions, attendees' main motive is update their peers about their tasks.

## Rules

* The length of the meeting should not exceed more than 10 mins (even shorter is better).
* Even if there are only 2 people, we should have meeting on time. People who couldn't join the meeting, have to share their update in the Slack channel before the start of Stand-up.
